	* A tiny prettification/optimisation from Sebastian Nagel.
	
	* Included (finally) a words file so that there is no
	  need to look for one in the system (obsoletes the
	  patch suggested in "[rt.cpan.org #17820] MSWin32 test fix").
	
	* Release as 1.17.

	* Newlines in patterns didn't work.  Fix from Bart Lateur.

	* Limit the number of words used for the big test,
	  split the big test to its own test file.
	
	* Release as 1.16.

	* Sigh.  The t/presuf.t would also fail if no words 
	  file could be found because of faulty test logic.
	  Reported by Paul Schinder.

	* Release as 1.15.

	* The ppclinux /usr/dict/words still tripped the test suite.
	  (No actual bug in the presuf() code)  Reported by Paul Schinder.
	
	* Release as 1.14.

	* Add aggregate timings to the big test, the original patch
	  supplied by Mike Giroux.

	* Cosmetics changes in presuf.t output.
	
	* Release as 1.13.

	* Ahem.  In 1.11 I fixed the test suite against empty
	  test inputs but forgot to fix presuf() itself against
	  empty inputs.
	
	* Release as 1.12.

	* The test suite would got stuck if there were no words
	  beginning with a certain letter.  Reported by Paul Schinder.

	* Now testing also words ending with a certain letter.

	* Give an estimate on the remaining testing time on the big
	  vocabulary test as it may take a while.

	* Release as 1.11.

	* Handle metacharacters: now you can use the regular
	  expression metacharacters in your words withour fear
	  of the resulting regex being illegal (famous last words?)
          Note that this also also means that if you have been using
	  metacharacters in your words, they will now be backslash-protected.
	
	* Run a big test (and time-consuming, up to several minutes)
	  in case we can find a dictionary file (like /usr/dict/words).
	  Show also timings compared with the naïve way.  They look sweet:

	# Hang on, collecting words for the next test...
	# Got 25486 words.
	# NOTE THAT THIS TEST WILL TAKE SEVERAL MINUTES.
	# WE WILL TEST ALL THE LETTERS FROM a TO z.
	# Testing 1408 words beginning with 'a'...
	# Naïve/create:    0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.00 CPU)
	# Naïve/execute:  15 wallclock secs (14.52 usr +  0.02 sys = 14.53 CPU)
	# PreSuf/create:   1 wallclock secs ( 1.72 usr +  0.03 sys =  1.75 CPU)
	# PreSuf/execute:  3 wallclock secs ( 2.08 usr +  0.02 sys =  2.10 CPU)
	# Testing 1277 words beginning with 'b'...
	# Naïve/create:    0 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.02 CPU)
	# Naïve/execute:  13 wallclock secs (13.08 usr +  0.03 sys = 13.12 CPU)
	# PreSuf/create:   2 wallclock secs ( 1.45 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.45 CPU)
	# PreSuf/execute:  1 wallclock secs ( 1.37 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.37 CPU)
	# Testing 2144 words beginning with 'c'...
	# Naïve/create:    0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.00 CPU)
	# Naïve/execute:  23 wallclock secs (22.40 usr +  0.05 sys = 22.45 CPU)
	# PreSuf/create:   3 wallclock secs ( 2.90 usr +  0.02 sys =  2.92 CPU)
	# PreSuf/execute:  3 wallclock secs ( 2.90 usr +  0.00 sys =  2.90 CPU)
	# Testing 1145 words beginning with 'd'...

	  The naïve way is just to concatenate the words with "|"
	  (that's the Naïve/create).  PreSuf/create is the presuf() call.
	  The */execute are the running times of the respective
	  regular expressions.		
	
	* Release as 1.10.  The jump in the version number is
	  warranted by the fixed handling of metacharacters.

	* PreSuf.pm: make the debug prints only to show up
	  when debugging requested (aaargh, I've developed
	  a bad habit of doing this lately, leaving debugging
	  on for the released versions), spotted by Mike Giroux.

	* Fix two bugs spotted by Mike Giroux: qw(rattle rattlesnake)
	  and qw(rata ratepayer rater) didn't produced correct results.

	* Release as 1.03.  

Sat May  6 01:17:24 2000  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Fix a bug where qw(aba a) was presufixed as 'ab?a',
	  which incorrectly matches qw(aba aa).
	  Now correctly produces 'a(?:ba)?'.  Bug spotted by
	  Mark Kvale. 

	* Release as 1.02.

Wed Apr 12 19:33:37 2000  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Release as 1.01. 

Wed Apr 12 05:49:52 2000  Jarkko Hietaniemi  <jhi@iki.fi>

	* Tell about prefix_length() and suffix_length().
	
	* Fixed tiny documentation nits.

	* Bump version number to 0.005.
